# Thermodynamics
An overview of the concepts and equations of Thermodynamics

After many disorganized and poorly taught thermo classes, I was frustrated that I never gained an intuition for the subject, so relearned it on my own and organized my notes into a (relatively) concise cheatsheet for my and your reference. In making this I learned to appreciate the beautiful organization and genius connections in Thermodynamics, and I hope you will too!
